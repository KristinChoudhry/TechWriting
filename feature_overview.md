# Product Catalog

The Product Catalog centralizes all sellable items, bundles, and pricing logic. It helps teams launch, manage, and update offers consistently across markets.

This feature reduces manual configuration, enforces consistency, and accelerates time-to-market. It is most useful for billing administrators and product managers.

## Streamlining your product offerings

Creating products from scratch for each variation is time-consuming and error-prone. The Product Catalog solves this by:
- Standardizing product structures, attributes, and pricing rules.
- Supporting reusable components and bundles.
- Enforcing governance via roles and approvals.

If you work with entities, note:
- Account represents your customer. Accounts can exist in hierarchies and are used for subscriptions and billing.
